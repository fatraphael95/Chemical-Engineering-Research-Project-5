**Thesis Title:** Red Blood Cell Distribution in Complex Microvascular Networks

**Abstract:**
Diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease frequently and adversely affect the globalpopulation and these conditions are commonly associated with blood and micro-circulatory disorders.Despite current treatments, there is a need for more advanced medical treatments and therapiesfor disease prevention and patient treatment. Unfortunately, there have been significant challengesin quantitatively describing the blood flow behaviours observed in the micro-vessels due to thecomplexity of micro-circulatory blood flow in the human body. Furthermore, there may be gapsin the understanding of haemodynamic mechanisms in micro-scale systems where computationalmodelling could be a potent tool to elucidate the observed blood flow behaviours in micro-circulation.In this study, the existing particle-based simulation data of blood flow in 3D complex microvascularnetworks were investigated.  The evaluated predictions from several established reduced-ordermodels were then analysed against simulation data to identify the contributing factors for theobservable effects.  The results from this study demonstrate the existence of plasma skimmingeffects in the microvascular networks, therefore implying that the RBC distribution within thestudied networks is flow-mediated. The results have also shown that the hydrodynamic diameter isa preferable input parameter for apparent viscosity estimations. Furthermore, it was observed thatthe distance ratio (L/DH) could be an additional contributing factor to relative apparent viscosityas this influences the asymmetric RBC distribution across the network. Based on these findings,these insights can act as building blocks to formulate a simplified yet robust reduced-order modelfor future investigations. In summary, this contributes to attaining a better understanding of theradial distribution of RBCs in micro-vessels based on fluid mechanical perspectives.

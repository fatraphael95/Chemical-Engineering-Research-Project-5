\noindent This section presents an introduction of micro-circulatory blood flow and a literature review of the blood flow distributions in micro-circulations. The blood flow in micro-circulations has several distinctive features\cite{BloodFlowSecomb, AnnualReview} that are discussed in this section to provide a basic understanding of the different physical mechanisms and contributing factors observed from past studies. Several haemodynamic effects observed in microvascular networks are covered in Section \ref{HaemodynamicEffects} along with an overview of the current challenges in reduced-order models for computational studies. Last but not least, the research gaps in the literature are identified and this includes a brief discussion on the physical perspectives of RBCs and blood flow in microvascular networks.

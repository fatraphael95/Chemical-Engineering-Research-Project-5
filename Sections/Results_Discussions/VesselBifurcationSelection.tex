\noindent For the study of RBCs distribution in microvascular networks, three different regions of interest (ROIs) were selected with a specific focus on diverging bifurcations (i.e comprise of one parent branch and two downstream child branches) as shown in Figure \ref{ROIs}. To achieve an independent characterisation of the systematic RBC partitioning behaviours taking place in the studied networks, only branches from these diverging bifurcations are chosen for data analysis. Collectively, 23 diverging bifurcations and 57 independent branches (excluding 12 identical branches) were selected from the three ROIs with diameters ranging from 2.3 $\mu$m to 23 $\mu$m and branch lengths ranging from 6.5 $\mu$m to 60.6 $\mu$m. Furthermore, the system haematocrit was found to be around 21.8\%. (see Figure \ref{SystemHaematocrit} in Appendix \ref{SystemHaematocritInMicrovascularNetworks})

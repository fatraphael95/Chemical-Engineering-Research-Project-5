\noindent In this section, all of the evaluated results obtained from data analysis are explained with discussions where several key findings are highlighted. Section \ref{Vessel_Bifurcation_Selection} summarises the ranges of branch diameter and length found within the total number of eligible vessels and bifurcation selected for data analysis. In Section \ref{RBC_Enrichment_Depletion}, prediction of RBC enrichment or depletion branches with different variables is identified and discussed, followed by demonstrating the presence of plasma skimming effects within the studied networks in Section \ref{Plasma_Skimming_Effects}. The evaluated deviations between empirical predictions against simulation data for apparent viscosity is analysed in Section \ref{BreakdownInPriesViscosityModels} and subsequently validating the presence of F{\aa}hr{\ae}us-Lindqvist effect in Section \ref{Fahraeus_Lindqvist_Effect}. The influence of branch length and distance ratio onto apparent viscosity is demonstrated in Section \ref{BranchLength_DistanceRatio} which leads to identifying the contributing factors to asymmetric RBC distribution in Section \ref{ContributingFactorsTOAsymmetricRBCDistribution}. Finally, identified invalid data points are mentioned and discussed in Section \ref{InvalidDataPoints} with justifiable reasons.

% \noindent In this section, all of the evaluated results obtained from data analysis are explained with discussions where several key findings are highlighted. Both evaluated results and discussions are based on a curiosity-driven approach where each key finding leads directs the next investigation to discover new results and point out the key highlights. \\

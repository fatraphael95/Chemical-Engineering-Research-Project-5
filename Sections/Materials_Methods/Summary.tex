\noindent For this research project, the computer simulations were conducted by Qi Zhou\cite{2020Charles} while all of the data extraction and analyses are entirely my own work. The Materials \& Methods section explains how the simulation data was generated in Section \ref{GenerationOfSimulationData} and highlights what are the measured and calculated parameters gathered from the simulation data in Section \ref{Post_Processing}. Section \ref{Reduced_Order_Models} covers the relevant well-known reduced-order models for data analysis and comparison with simulation data. All in all, this section is dedicated to introducing all of the measurement methods and data processing involved in data analysis.
